# Simon-Game
The concept behind Simon Game is that there is a pattern being generated while for user randomly.

Each level has the four colours and you have to remember the previous pattern or sequence of colours which has been generated
throughout the previous levels and the last colour is generated for the next level. 

User needs to remember which colours have been generated from level 1 to the current level and also remember the newly 
generated colour. If you get the complete sequence correctly then you progress to next level otherwise, it's the game over
and you can start again.
